Q1. What does HAS-A relationship in Java signify
A) Inheritance
B) Encapsulation
C) Composition or Aggregation
D) Polymorphism

Answer C) Composition or Aggregation

Q2. Which of the following statements about HAS-A relationship is correct
A) It is implemented using inheritance (extends keyword).
B) It is implemented using object references.
C) It is only possible with primitive data types.
D) It requires overriding methods from the parent class.

Answer B) It is implemented using object references.

Q3. How can we establish a HAS-A relationship in Java
A) Using implements keyword
B) Using extends keyword
C) By creating an object of one class inside another class
D) By using super keyword

Answer C) By creating an object of one class inside another class

Q5. What is the difference between composition and aggregation in HAS-A relationship
A) Composition has a weaker association than aggregation.
B) Aggregation represents a strong dependency, while composition does not.
C) Composition means the contained object cannot exist independently, while aggregation allows independent existence.
D) Both are the same concept with no difference.

Answer C) Composition means the contained object cannot exist independently, while aggregation allows independent existence.

Q6.

class Engine
{
    void start()
    {
        System.out.println(Engine started);
    }
}

class Car
{
   Engine engine = new Engine();

    void startCar()
    {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car started");
    }
}
public class Test
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.startCar();
    }
}

What type of HAS-A relationship does the Car class have with Engine

A) Aggregation
B) Composition
C) Inheritance
D) Polymorphism

Answer B) Composition (since Engine is tightly coupled with Car and cannot exist independently)


Q7. Which of the following is an example of aggregation
A) A Person class containing an Address object where Address can exist independently.
B) A Car class containing an Engine object where Engine cannot exist without Car.
C) A Dog class extending an Animal class.
D) A Bank class inheriting from a FinancialInstitution class.

Answer A) A Person class containing an Address object where Address can exist independently.


Q8. Which of the following is a key benefit of using HAS-A relationship over IS-A relationship

A) It promotes code reusability without tight coupling.
B) It forces subclasses to override all parent methods.
C) It makes method overriding easier.
D) It restricts the ability to create new classes.

Answer A) It promotes code reusability without tight coupling.


Q9. Find the output of the following code.

class Engine
{
    void start()
    {
        System.out.println("Engine started.");
    }
}

class Car
{
    private Engine engine;

    Car()
    {
        engine = new Engine();  // Engine is created inside Car
    }

    void startCar()
    {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car started.");
    }
}

public class CompositionExample
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.startCar();
    }
}

ANS: Engine Started
     Car Started


Q10) Find the output of the following
class Address
{
    String city, state;

    Address(String city, String state)
    {
        this.city = city;
        this.state = state;
    }

    void displayAddress()
    {
        System.out.println(city + ,  + state);
    }
}

class Student
{
    String name;
    Address address;

    Student(String name, Address address)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.address = address;
    }

    void displayStudent()
    {
        System.out.println(Student  + name);
        System.out.print(Address);
        address.displayAddress();
    }
}

public class AggregationExample
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Address addr = new Address("New York", "USA");
        Student student = new Student("John Doe", "addr");
        student.displayStudent();
    }
}

ANS: Student  John Doe
     Address Address@2a84aee7
     New York , USA
